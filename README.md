## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- responsive in mind
- love â™¥

### What I learned

This was a very easy challenge. The only reason why I did it was because it was completely free, including the figma file which I appriciate. Because of it's simplicity I didnt learn much. One small thing I learned was fit-content as an option when defining the width of an element. Thats actually kinda convinient to know. 

```css
.tags {
  width: fit-content;
}
```
